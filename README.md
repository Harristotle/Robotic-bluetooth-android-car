# Robotic-bluetooth-android-car
This is an arduino sketch and Android app to control a robot car via bluetooth.

Details and description of the protocol, the pinouts and connections are in the
comments of the sketch (.ino) file.

The android app was written in MIT app inventor 2, found at http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu

To modify or develop the app, go to your own instance of app inventor http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu
and import the RoboTroller.aia file. You can just install the built binary from RoboTroller.apk

The code for the arduino is in the robotic-car-bt-hbridge-leon.ino file. If you want
to change the protocol, add sensors etc, here is the place to start.
Enjoy!
